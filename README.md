Product card created using flexbox, splitting image and content-wrapper. Mobile version, the flex direction is column.

Desktop version of max-width: 600px
In order flex direction changed to row, and in order to a 50/50 split view, i set flex basis for both image and content-wrapper to flex-basis:300px. It worked but i am not sure if this is the best way.
